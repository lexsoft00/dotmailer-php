# Dotmailer REST API (v2) PHP client [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/wellcometrust/dotmailer-php.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/wellcometrust/dotmailer-php)

PHP client library for the Dotmailer REST API (v2) described at https://developer.dotmailer.com/docs/

Installation
---
`composer require wellcometrust/dotmailer-php`

Usage
---
```
<?php

use Dotmailer\Adapter\GuzzleAdapter;
use Dotmailer\Dotmailer;

require 'vendor/autoload.php';

$adapter = GuzzleAdapter::fromCredentials('apiuser-XYZ@apiconnector.com', 'PASSWORD');
$dotmailer = new Dotmailer($adapter);

$addressBooks = $dotmailer->getAddressBooks();
print_r($addressBooks);

If you are using Symfony, you may choose to configure the service as follows, and then use throughout your application:
```
# app/config/services.yml

Dotmailer\Adapter:
   factory: ['Dotmailer\Adapter\GuzzleAdapter', fromCredentials]
   arguments: ['%dotmailer_username%', '%dotmailer_password%', '%dotmailer_uri%']

Dotmailer\Dotmailer:
   arguments: ['@Dotmailer\Adapter']
```
